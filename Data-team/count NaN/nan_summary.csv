 'Recently bought a house for our young family (newborn). House needs minor improvements: air conditioner, stair railing remodel (baby can climb through very easily as stairs are old).  Doing this to keep baby comfortable and safe.  I have excellent credit. Both wife and I have stable jobs (dual income, both professionals with graduate degrees). I have been in my line of work over 10 years.  We bought our house with a fixed interest loan without any government or external support.  No revolving credit bills (credit card paid off fully each month).  Only a single car lease, student loan and mortgage.  Since I did not believe in ARMs or buying beyond my means, we save our money and bought our home when the market fell.  I thought I would wait for the A/C until next year, but learning to live with a young baby is an everyday learning experience.  Now I feel that its a necessary improvement to make.  Also when buying the house, it never occurred to me that a growing baby would be able to step through baulisters and create a safety hazard.  '

 '  Borrower added on 01/24/13 > My personal loan is to pay off all revolving credit lines.

 ""  Borrower added on 02/24/11 > The purpose of this loan is to consolidate my debt. I do make all my payments on time and have never had a deliquent account. I'm just trying to make my life easier and have one bill for all my debts. Currently I am paying up to $850 a month which includes 3 CC and 1 loan. This loan would definitely be ideal since I will just have to make one payment at $523 a month. The loan is set out for 60 months but I do plan on paying it off before my term is up. My interest rates of course are high on my credit cards varying from 20% to 29%. My monthly expenses consist of 650 for rent, 200 for utility bills, 300 for misc cell phone gas etc. My job is very stable. I work for a movie studio in the global security department. If there are any questions you may have, please ask. Thank you all in advance.<br/>""

 ' I am trying to consolidate three credit cards that I have. They total a little more than 15000 but I do not need any more than that. I think I am a very qualified person for this loan because I have only had one late payment since I was 18 and I am now 31. The late payment happened in 2004. My credit score is about 755. The late payment happpened because of a family emergency while I was in the Army. I will be using the money to consolidate three Chase credit cards that I have. (The reason I have three Chase credit cards is because they bought out the two other companies that I orginally got the credit cards from.) I would just like to have one fixed payment a month instead of worrying about 4. They also have been raising interest rates on my credit cards because of the times that we are going through right now nationally. I hope this helps you out with what I am trying to do.'
